Before I go into my notes, I have a hilarious fact I need to share -
before reading the spec for Assignment 3, I thought to myself "Oh wow,
It's already week 4--I've been learning how to use GIT, maybe a good
practice exercise would be to learn React & Node.js at the same time".
And, in doing so, I accidentally did the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial before the
assignment!  The gitHub link is as follows:

I did some general commenting as notes on the source code itself --
that being said, I'm going to go over my code a second time, and 
leave some notes below as my thoughts...
